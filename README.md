## Epoch Mission System [EMS]
### Version 0.2.5
#### fixes from 23.12.2013 by Fuchs 

_Credits: Lazyink, TheSzerdi, Falcyn , TAWTonic, EPOCH DEV's<br>
Merged DayZ Chernarus Mission System's from TheSzerdi and Lazyink with permission._


Epoch Mission System ( EMS ) is a modified version of Lazyink & TheSzerdi's DayZ Chernarus Mission systems. The two projects were merged by Fuchs and released with some SargeAI configs to enhance the gameplay of Epoch Chernarus servers. The project was then renamed to "Epoch Mission System" after MimiC joined Fuchs and further development was done on it. It has now been released as a new project, with a total of 26 unique missions that are specific to Epoch servers.
The Sarge AI conig has been removed.
DZAI is a need as the variables have been changed to it!

_This mission system will not work properly on non-Epoch servers or servers that do not have DZAI already installed._

**Requirements:**

* Notepad++
* PBO Manager
* Epoch 1.0.3.1 Server
* DZAI 

**Difficulty**

Easy : 10-15 minutes

* Some knowledge of Epoch Server & Mission file locations
* How to use PBO manager to unpack and pack PBO files

### Mission PBO Instructions

Unpack your mission PBO file using PBO Manager into a folder

Copy the <b>debug</b> folder from the EMS download to the root of your mission folder

<b>Edit your init.sqf file</b>

At the very end of you <b>init.sqf</b> file paste the following block of code:

    // Mission System Markers
    [] execVM "debug\addmarkers.sqf";
    [] execVM "debug\addmarkers75.sqf";

This will make the mission markers show up on the map for players that have died and respawn, or connect to the server after a mission has already spawned.

<b>Repack your mission PBO using PBO Manager and replace your existing _mission_.pbo file</b>

<b>Next year follows the integration of DayZ Bandit AI ,the current AI will be removed then</b>
